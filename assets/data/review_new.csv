"Jeaniessi","As with Boys Over Flowers, I am almost afraid to review this for fear of flames. I did not like this drama. The reasons?1) I do not like it when a woman blindly and stupidly follows a man that mostly could care less and treats her like crap on a regular basis.2) I do not like it when a teenage girl is portrayed as completely without sense and is kind of a stalker.3) Even worse when she is encouraged by said boy's mother!  The mother helps her stalk her own son! I liked the actress, I did but that's just too much for me to wrap my mind around.Maybe I am too old for this one.  I did not like the message it sends.  I am all for going with a story.  I can forgive a lot because I have a ridiculous romantic side to me but this one left me wanting to yell at that girl and shake her out of her blind stupidity.Here is what I did like: The boy kind of redeems himself toward the end and she wakes up at the last minute...kind of. ..but not enough.","119","3.0","3.0","8.0","7.0","3.0"
"JohnGilbert","READ THIS IF YOU WANT A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS DRAMAI hope some take a moment to read this. I am not the best writer. I haven't wrote a lot of reviews yet, but this one forced my hand. I hope it isn't a waste of your time. Also, I hope you give my perspective some consideration. This is a gem.I have thought many times how I should start this review. However, I do not think I will be emphatic enough of how this Kdrama affected me no matter how much I try.Oh well here we go...Playful Kiss was pure, heartfelt joy for me. I am likely going to come at this in a somewhat unique angle. I have to immediately share that I have read much of the hate or criticisms of this drama...mostly about Oh Ha Ni's 'pathetic' puppy dog love and her incessant pursuit of Baek Seung Jo. Which I will deal with later...but a HUGE 'PFFT' – whatever. I see how it made her look dependent, stalker, etc. They even took exception with the mother encouraging this. It makes me wonder what they were watching, but I have my opinion and as I said, I will cover that later. I DO NOT really want to make this negative. This drama is purely about the positive.A short preamble of sorts. I am relatively new to Kdrama's. I have around 20 under my belt as of writing this review. I think I have a fairly well rounded resume, you can peruse my list if you like, but I have never watched one like 'Playful Kiss'...apparently. Why 'apparently'? It left many of the sinister tropes behind. The overbearing parent, the evil in-law, the person at school or work or wherever that serves as the antagonist. The heal. The 'hated' one or several in some dramas. This was completely devoid of that!!!!!!! It blew me away. It was pure love, warmth, and heart. I do not believe I have watched ANYTHING like this in my life! I am American and our purity on TV left decades ago. The closest we get is shlock filled, syrupy, inane dramas on like ABC Family that are as deep as a puddle and as interesting as insurance forms. This drama had spunk and had loads of REAL laughs. Yes, mostly at the expense of Oh Ha Ni, but in the sweetest way imaginable.I wrote in the forum part for this drama about how it completely compared to 'Bridget Jone's Diary'. I said, how 'Bridget Jone's Diary' would be an adult, 'R' rated version, while this would be the high school, family equivalent. Both had a hapless, hopeless romantic lead protagonist that went to great lengths and often made fools of themselves over a man. 'Bridget Jone's Diary' was a critical darling and 'Playful Kiss' has a descent rating on mydramalist, but way too many high brow people looking down their noses at Oh Ha Ni because she was too vulnerable and too often let a man define her...yada, yada, yada! First question I have, um, Bong Joon Gu was EVERY bit as clingy to Oh Ha Ni. He even continued after she was married. He told her that if Seung Jo is now her house, he would be her 'insurance'. Yes, the writers or director brought in Chris to turn Joon Gu's head at the end, but he was still clinging to Ha Ni. No one mentions him as exhibiting the same behavior. It was her character only. That to me is sexist. Once again you bring undue attention to the female doing something when a male was largely guilty of the same thing. She was every bit his 'knight in shining armour' and Joon Gu said so much! Ha Ni went through growth over the arch of the series just as Bridget did. She at the end was confident that Seung Jo was every bit taken with her as she was of him. She had matured and was working hard.I have a theory as to why there are so many pointing out Ha Ni's supposed 'pathetic-ness'. At least from an American perspective, and likely a European perspective, is cynicism. We have gotten so 'empowered' that any show of selling oneself out for another is a show of weakness. I think a lot more relationships and marriages would go a lot further if BOTH individuals were to give up themselves completely for the other. It isn't PC, especially for a woman, to want to give themselves totally to the other. It's often worded 50/50. That's a hedge. Someone may cry semantics, but each giving 100% of themselves for the other is the way to be. I think that was reached in the end albeit Seung Jo was much more reserved in exhibiting his devotion, but he did. I do wish they had him coming to her defense more and stronger, but alas, they didn't. The beginning was about her devotion and lampooned it as such. It was admitted many times to being one sided, but her perseverance paid off. I just think that too many judged her unfairly. She did nothing sordid. She didn't do anything deserving reproach, she was just wide-eyed and too full of heart.I am not sure I articulated my point well enough the above point, but I will move on.Some complained and some LOVED Kim Hyun Joong. I am betting some of the devotees to Hyun Joong are nearly as starry eyed as Ha Ni because he is handsome. However, he seems to be a one note actor at the moment. I have only seen him in 'Boys Over Flowers' and this. I don't hate him. What the director wants from him, he has down to a science. Hyun Joong's performance was nearly an extension of Yoon Ji Hoo. However, for me, he was not what drove this movie, nor was he what touched my heart so much by this drama. He was merely a pawn. He was Ha Ni's carrot and that is about it. I will say this because of the way he plays his part through out, when his tone does change it hits you! The viewer feels it because most of the series he acts arrogant and is brooding all the time so when he does lower his guard and shows his love for Ha Ni the viewer always feels it. However, once again, the series acknowledges that!! He does. His friends do. His MOTHER does always. Even his little worshiping brother does near the end! They all acknowledge that he has personality issues. So to point it out seems rather silly BECAUSE EVERYONE knows it! LOL! It was his known flaw that would expose other flaws in his seemingly perfect demeanor. Ha Ni wears her flaws on her sleeve. They are there for everyone to see...and every one freely talks about them too.Here's my heart felt feeling in the end, this drama was nothing but love. It permeated the entire series. It's warmth never wavered. I would love to live in a cocoon such as Ha Ni's. In spite her flaws, she brought warmth to everyone she touched and everyone surrounding her brought the love to her too. Her friends, her father, Seung Jo's parents, Joon Gu, her senior homeroom teacher, even Yoon Ha Rae was won over!! Jung So Min was radiant! She played this part as well as you could hope. The way she stumbled. The way she bit her lip. The way she shrunk when she knew she screwed up. I get teary eyed just thinking how special she was in this role...and the hate for her character -UGH! I DO NOT get it. She was a bit naïve sure, but she was so pure in every action how could you not cheer for her. When Seung Jo's mother, Geum Hee, came to her defense and pointed out the heart she brought to their lives it was awe inspiring.I would love to flesh out more about each of these examples in her friends, Seung Jo's family, etc, but I will only touch on them a little. It was ALL of them that lead to my captivation with this series. I could only imagine having friends such as Ha Ni's and that includes Joon Gu. Her father was so gentle and worked so hard and gave his all for his daughter. However, for me the ones that filled my heart most was Seung Jo's parents. Yes, at first the mother, Geum Hee, seemed off. She seemed to have a screw loose and was weird, but that, at least for me, faded quickly. Her character was explained deeper. She became second only Ha Ni as my most beloved, but that only seems right since they were meant to be VERY similar, if not mirrors of one another. Their out pouring of support and uncompromising support for Ha Ni and her dad was profound. It brought buckets of tears from me.Speaking of tears, I sobbed so many times during this series. From tears of joy, to tears of sharing their heartache, but it was always a pure heartache never a malicious heartache. The type that just comes with life. People come and go. We say good bye, and if you have a heart, most good byes are misty eyed. I tell my boys the most painful things in life are good byes.So to maybe conclude, the cynicism this series has garnered from some is truly baffling. It's charming from start to finish. Having a happy ending with everyone finding love is unrealistic. People are right, life is mired in pain, suffering, hatred, bigotry, gossiping, backstabbing, greed, and so many other morose happenings. And thank God above this series doesn't have them. This is bliss start to finish, with just the mild bumps along the way. I'll tell you what, there are plenty of dramas that explore those ugly parts of life. Once in a while, isn't it nice to experience a story where people are good and helpful to each other. Doesn't that sound glorious? We live atrocity, why then would we want to ONLY champion that and watch series about that? Why wouldn't we want to escape for a while in a gentle, sweet world that largely doesn't exist in the real world, but wouldn't it be nice if it did? I'm 44. I had a marriage of 22 years end with lies, a wife committing adultery, a broken family through divorce etc. I'm tired of all that. It was a breath of fresh air to live in this drama for a little while. I ordered it on DVD and bought the soundtrack. Now I will not just seek out dramas like this. I will still watch and love the dramas with all the usually Kdrama tropes and expect story devices, but when life has me shaking my head, I will lose myself in this series for a moment and realize how people should treat each other.","37","10","9.0","10","10","10"
"Rourou","1-The reason I watched this : As a huge fan of Itazura Na kiss I was hunting down all the dramas adaptations, this was the 2nd adaptation after I saw the disappointing J-version.2-Storyline/Plot : This drama cut many events from the manga; there were some changes from the original story but the plot was the same. The foolishness, the childish events, those happy romantic and sometimes sad dramatic moments were present which brought back a lot of memories from one of my favorite stories ever!It was fun to see this adaptation even though I wasn't really dazzled since it lacked many important events.3-Acting/Cast : I like Kim Hyun Joong because he's attractive but let's face it hes not that great as an actor plus his Beak Seung Jo's coldness really was exagerated sometimes yet it reminds me of Naoki's personality in the anime.Although OH Ha Ni was a stupid stalker, I never found her character annoying (Probably because she's much better than Kotoko in the Jversion)The supporting roles were really great especially Baek Seung Jo's mother; her character was really good to watch (a nice change from other evil mothers in Korean dramas) plus Bong Joon Gu and Oh Ha Ni's friends remind me of those from the anime.4-The ending : Well, there is the YouTube Edition so this is not considered as an ""end"".It would have been much bette if they extended it or made a second season because it didn't have much core like the Tw-version.5-My impression: I felt the story of Itazura na kiss all over again and most importantly I was able to gorget about the J-version disappointment. Even though, I wanted it to be a little different but I didn't hate it.6-Overall : If you are Itazura na kiss fan you need to watch this.If you like rom-com then you may like this.If you like seeing cute cast theb you would like this.P.S : The korean version was a medium between the disappointing Japanese version and the marvelous Taiwanese version.","33","8.0","8.0","8.0","8.0","7.0"
"bubblefaerie","I wasn't intending to watch another version of Itazura na Kiss right after finishing one, but Netflix has a limited selection of dramas and this has been in my queue for years. I decided to give it a shot despite generally low reviews... and I liked it.The story is the same as the last version I watched and it didn't really have anything different going on. I did think it was paced well. I liked that we got to see more of high school before they went to college. I also liked that we got to see some of what happened after a lot of romantic comedies end. It was a little rushed at the end but they did cram in what probably would have been the beginning of a second season if they did those.What I didn't like was all the fantasy sequences, especially at the beginning. As it tapered off, the few here and there were more tolerable.I also thought that some of the scenes felt contrived. They just didn't seem to follow a natural progression and it seemed like they said ""We have to get this in here"" and just made a scene to fit the situation without much thought to the flow.I liked Jung So Min as Oh Ha Ni. I think it's almost unfair to talk about how stalkery she was because the story itself depends on her being a stalker. What I did like about her was that, despite the fact that she kept coming back, she had the sense to at least be angry and/or upset by the way Baek Seung Jo treated her.Kim Hyun Joong as Baek Seung Jo wasn't wonderful but he wasn't awful. He was a lot less cold and detached and more deliberately mean. At times he was kind of intolerable and did remind me a little of Lee Shin from Goong (which makes sense seeing they have the same directors) but was not nearly as awful a person. He would do this thing, too, where he walked away and smiled that I thought was cute.I didn't like second lead at all. The relationship between Ha Ni and Bong Joon Gu was almost non-existent until it became necessary for there to be one. It never seemed like Ha Ni considered him a close friend and I didn't feel any chemistry between the actors. There was way more chemistry between him and Ha Ni's friend, especially Joo Ri. And if Ha Ni was stalking Seung Jo, then Joon Gu was a step away from locking her in a basement.I enjoyed a lot of the secondary cast. The mother was really fun to watch. I also liked Kyung Soo.Most of the music didn't register with me. Netflix didn't show the intro so I didn't even hear that song until later. I did like the song from Bye Bye Sea and enjoyed the band playing at the break.I enjoyed Playful Kiss. It's hard not to compare this one with the other I've seen (Love in Tokyo) because there are things I liked better in this one and things I liked better in the other. But in the end, I liked this one just a little bit more because I liked Ha Ni more. The embarrassing moments that Ha Ni had were less ridiculous and I didn't feel the need to turn it off during those times. I don't know that I'd watch it again, but I enjoyed it while I was watching it.And on a side note, I love that they did the bear endings.","14","8.0","8.0","8.5","4.5","3.5"
"SeRose","Funny how there's nothing really special about this, yet it's super cute to watch, even if they main characters have practically no chemistry together. They still make my heart pound in emphathetic angst at least once every episode. A little too long by the end (the second last episode was atrocious!), but overall a fun little watch. Honestly I thought I would hate this, but I found myself enjoying it against my will.","24","7.0","6.0","7.0","6.0","7.0"
"sky_fever","forgive me to those who are fan of the main role,....I was not gonna make a review of this drama now but since i've read other reviews, i just thought of having one........At first, you may seem to like this drama, a kind of man who is so serious, a bit snob and handsome looking. the female lead is so pretty too with a weak character. I liked it till the scenes when the girl wrote to this guy  about her feeling and instead of this guy to like her too, she was just belittled by the guy and it was a shame that everybody in school saw and heard it. that was a great start. I was thinking that the story will turn the other way around  but till the end .....................(WARNING).................................... she never changed! If you were in this situation, what would you be of? if it seems to you that the story is just right, ok watch it, but for those who doesn't want to be someone with no PRIDE at all to yourself, do not watch it, its a waste of time......","21","4.0","3.0","8.0","5.0","4.0"
"JCKdorama","I love dramas, and I know a good one when I see it. This...is a TERRIBLE drama. The acting and story were disappointing. I have seen the Tawainese version and feel in love with it. If you compare the two, it is clear that the Korean version falls short. The characters were not potrayed well at all! The rival guy wasn't even a rival! He was ignored most of the drama! Really the only thing I did like was the music and the woman who played the mother. She was hilarious! I watched the entire thing and it was a waste of my time. I also watched the short episodes at the end, and those were okay. Don't fall for the good looking actors, this is a joke of a drama and falls short at being a good manga adaption.","33","3.0","3.0","3.0","8.0","1.0"
"mcbrayer77","When I saw that Kim Hyun Joong was the lead for this drama I went wild. Even though i wasn't a HUGE fan of Boys Before Flowers i did like it, but I LOVED Hyun Joong as Ji Hoo. so naturally i started watching. I sooo wanted to like this drama, but it was impossible.Most of the blame should go to the writers of this drama, cause the story sucked big time. Hyun Joong did a decent job acting but like i said it was more of the crap role he got landed with instead of his acting ability cause i've seen him in other dramas and he can do much better than this.Oh Ha Ni on the other hand had a horrible script to go by and she also wasn't a very good actress. she wasn't terrible either, like i said the main fault lies with the writers. they made Oh Ha Ni the biggest stalker of all time, even by asian drama standards her character was super creepy and obsessive. And of course you know they're gonna get together in the end, and while in other dramas the annoying girl and the snob guy finally find middle ground and i can understand their relationship. in Playful kiss however i honestly don't understand how Hyun Joong's character falls for Oh Ha Ni...she's a stalker.the over ""cuteness"" of the already predictable story was almost unbearable. there were multiple times when i just wanted to give up and stop watching. the only thing that kept me going was my deep dislike of not finishing dramas, if not for that i would have ditched this drama after the first three episodes.idk maybe im being too harsh, and perhaps one day i'll go back and re-watch it, but for now i can say that this is the worst drama i've ever watched","19","2.0","2.0","4.0","5.0","1.0"
"KiRa","I will probably make some people mad with my review but it needs to be said. I watched this drama because of Kim Hyun Joong and because of positive reviews- this drama seemed to have a following like BOF- but despite Hyun Joong's ability to pull off his aloof character masterfully this drama was frustrating to say the least. I like to yell at characters from time to time (its just part of the experience like watching football- yeah they can't hear you but it makes you fell better) BUT in this drama I just wanted to SLAP Oh Ha Ni (played by Jung So Min). She was just pathetic and submissive and had no substance of her own. I feel like she could have been omitted from the story and it wouldn't have mattered. It was a romance and yet her pathetic nature did not make her enduring like it was intended too, it just made the character pathetic.  Additionally some characters seemed to come and go as the series went on and they added no real substance to the story. To the point where I felt I had missed some important part of the story line. Mom and brother were also irritating at times; I mean really if your mom is that involved then she should have just made him get married right out. Brother was a little annoying only because he was continually rude.I would not suggest this drama to anyone unless they just wanted to watch Hyun Joong be cute.I am sorry to any fans who loved this drama, but I just found so little redeeming about this drama. If I didn't believe in finishing every drama I start this would have been one of the few I dropped.","9","5.0","3.0","7.0","6.0","2.0"
"Taylorgg12","Being a lover of the Itazura Na Kiss anime and manga, I really liked this version of the story. I found the actors brought uniqueness to their characters right down to Baek Seung Jo's coldness to Oh Ha Ni annoying stupidity. They make you fall in love with them over and over again dispite how much you wanna hit them sometimes.I think the only down fall to this drama is their weren't enough moments between the main couple. But maybe that's just my personal wish to see more of Kim Hyun Joong haha.I recommend this drama to anyone.Happy Watching!","11","9.0","9.0","9.0","9.0","8.0"
"dramaqueen4life","this is one of the worst dramas i've seen..at first look it sounds amazing but few episodes into it one feels like throttling the writer ..this could have been a gem of a show coz d heroine was pretty..the hero was good looking too but in between it jst went downhill.i coulnt understand how a guy like that managed to have the gal like that in his life.even though she's dumb she's vry kind hearted and hard working so it more or less makes up for the dumb part.i hated the hero's coldness.i didnt find any chemistry in between them and if a guy treated a girl like that im sure the girl would run far away.atleast i would.this could have been a good drama but alas..blame it on the bad directing and the writing part","14","4.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","4.0"
"Momo-8-","I'm not sure where to start. I watched the anime version, and at least there was some growth or change in the story by the end. Usually the drama adaptations are better. But not in this case. I watched the entire series. I'm not even sure why it went on for 16 episodes.The thing that really bothers me is that Kim Hyun Joong's character is so static and unmoving, it eventually makes me feel bitter and resentful towards Jung So Min's character.Jung's character is adorable and hard working. I'm not sure why everyone is expecting her to change, since the obvious purpose of this show is to illustrate how Kim's character opens his heart after unconditional love and kindness. I think ultimately people get upset with Ha Ni because it seems like she loses all respect for herself.Beyond that, Kim's acting is almost worse in this show than Boys Before Flowers. It's like he doesn't even try to be a different character with different mannerisms. Kim's starring role in shows should just be for him to stand and look pretty since it hurts whenever he tries to act. It's okay if you hate me for saying that.I should try to say something nice about this drama.... I like the parents, Jung's character and her friends. I liked the mother-daughter relationship that Ha Ni and Seung Jo's mom have. I think the story itself has the potential to be good. It's just not.","9","3.0","3.0","6.0","4.0","1.0"
"Ari","Great Drama, My first one actually that was put into Netflix. Let me break it down in four categories.Story: The story is exactly like the original, although i've never watched the original i recommend you watching this one even though its extremely cheesy at first, after a while it gets much more better.Acting/Cast : The cast never left my eyes a stray, they knew what they were doing and how to do it. I doubt you'll be annoyed by any of their characters except for when the drama scenes pop up, haha.Rewatch Value : If you like to watch funny moments, mean moments that will still make you laugh, the cheesiness, i really recommend you watch it over.Overall : Basically the story starts off slow, but you'll fall in love with the cast as you go along into the story. It just keeps getting more and more better as you watch, This drama will not disappoint. and you have my word!~ Ariana","10","9.0","10","9.0","8.0","9.0"

"mangoman73","To this day, I don't know why I finished watching this. I don't want to be harsh on this drama, because I'm sure for some people it was wonderful, but for me it bordered on traumatic.Firstly, there are some elements of this which are nice. The cast are attractive and the female lead, Oh Ha Ni has a somewhat sute manner that is engaging.The problems I have with this drama are the following:1) Kim Hyun Joong. Attractive as hell? Yes. Fantastic actor? No. I believe Kim Hyun Joong improves on his previous efforst in this drama but the combination of him having a limited acting repertiore combined with a terrible script makes his character hard to love. And by hard to love, I mean vomit-worthy.2) The plot. If I want to spend a girl waste YEARS of her life chasing after a bastard, I'll pay attention to the love lives of those random people I knew in high school that I am now Facebook friends with. This story goes absolutely nowhere. NOWHERE.3) The message. This show is basically about a girl who is not very smart, being ridiculed when she confesses her love by a smart guy who is a real *insert expletive here*. She chases after him, he shuts her down, she keeps chasing, he leads her on, repeat. Yes girls, it doesn't matter if there is nothing good about him and he treats you horribly, keep going back for more. He's attractive, so it's worth it. She then continues to build her WHOLE LIFE around him. Enough said.4) The ending. I guess I watched this through to the finish in the hope that the ending would feature a whole heap of Kim Hyun Joong being like ""I'm sooo sorry, I thought I was so great, but really, I'm lucky you put up with me...""This did not happen. I'm sure many people were like ""Yay! Dating and marriage!"" However, even after they became a couple, he was still a %$#@*& and she became ridiculously neurotic (partially thanks to KHJ again, but still). Even when he does nice things, he does them so that WE, the AUDIENCE, know, but she HIS GF/WIFE never does. What a great guy.I couldn't feel any connection with the characters from this as I find  one lead to be a bully, and the other to be a chronic victim. I feel that if there had been a little bit of equality in their relationship I may have found this passable, I think it would have been watchable, if a bit boring. As it was, I felt a little ashamed that this story has an audience, because it is not a type of relationship I can ever understand.","8","3.0","4.0","2.0","5.0","1.0"
"DramaNoona","This review will go against the popular view, but I just couldn’t get truly invested in Playful Kiss.  It was the third drama I watched and after the first episode I turned it off.  It was too over the top, too campy, too much of everything, and not enough of anything to draw me in.  I went back to watching something that I can’t remember now, because through Hulu there weren’t that many Korean, Taiwanese, or Japanese dramas to choose from that I could easily find.  Combined with the fact I hadn’t really become fully addicted which meant I just didn’t take the time to look around I just moved on instead of trying something else.  However, after about a week or so I decided to give Playful Kiss another shot.  The second episode wasn’t as bad and the third was alright, and so on and so forth.  But, I just never really felt invested in the story or involved in the characters like I had with City Hunter and Boys Over Flowers.  I picked this drama because I absolutely loved Kim Hyun Joong in Boys Over Flowers, that was my only reason.  I learned my lesson about watching a drama just for a bias and now I do my research about the story and reviews before devoting my time.I really liked the idea of the story.  Girl has a huge crush on arrogant boy, a series of unfortunate events has the two families living together, and slowly arrogant boy sees the girl as his soul mate.  A totally sweet and cute idea and I was pretty excited to see it.  However, for me the execution of the story was lacking.  I kept wanting to like it, kept wanting to have it move me, kept wanting more from the show.  It just never got me in the feels.Throughout the entire shore I saw little growth in the characters themselves, they remained as immature and aloof as they were when the show began.  I wanted to see more development of Oh Ha Ni, there was so much they could have done to show her growing up.  Yet she remained perpetually a child in actions and mentality.  Then Baek Seung Jo never seemed to change, he began as a narcissistic and egotistical character and ended exactly the same.  Once Baek Seung Jo admitted that he loved Oh Ha Ni he was as cold to her as he had been when he hated her.  There was no warmth, no affection, and certainly no chemistry between them.  For me the main couple totally fell short, and left me cool.Even though the lead couple didn’t really meet my expectations, I loved the secondary couple.  Bong Joon Gu and Chris were absolutely adorable!  The moment she came into the noodle house and stared at Bong Joon Gu with that puppy love gaze I loved them.  There was real emotion there and reaction.  However, the bromance of the fathers Oh Ki Dong and Baek Soo Chang was amazing.  Every time they had a scene together I loved it!  They were just cute together and I wanted to see more of them.  On top of that Oh Ha Ni’s relationship with her father, Oh Ki Dong was lovely.  Their moments almost made up for the lack of feeling between Oh Ha Ni and Baek Seung Jo.I also really enjoyed the big reveal kiss in the rain.  Even though I didn’t care for the series as much as I wanted to, that kiss is in my top five best kisses.  For that moment, for whatever reason, the leads made me believe that they were in love.  I just wish that passion and fire had carried through to the episodes after the kiss.Playful Kiss just dragged for me.  If it were me now as opposed to six months ago I would have stopped watching and just moved on to something else.  However, back then I felt guilty for not sticking with a show from beginning to end.  But with full time work, a husband, and a rambunctious five year old I just don’t have the free time to commit to a show that doesn’t immediately capture my heart.Noona's RatingOverall: 7 (I rated this 3 stars on DramaFever.com)Story/Writing: 7Cast/Actors: 7OST: 7Sets/Costumes: 8Feels: 6","7","7.0","7.0","7.0","7.0","7.0"

"eunmia","Kim Hyun Joong has as many emotions as a toilet seat, the plot was blatantly stretched and boring. This must be one of the worst dramas I've watched. Just the whole idea of having a drama like this, what were the script writers and producers thinking? Feels like it was written by a couple of 10 year olds.","9","4.0","3.0","4.0","8.0","4.0"
"coming_dreams","So first of all, this drama was my first ever korean drama I have ever watched in my life. My friend recommended this drama to me and after I started watching it, I found out that it was the Korean version of It Started With a Kiss. ISWAK was my first Taiwanese drama I remembered(I watched many dramas when I was younger but I don't remember them as well) and I thought it was fair.Story: Let's say, to be honest, there isn't much of a real plot going on. It's just the girl trying to win the guy over, basically, for the entire 16 episodes. Yes, it does get boring at some parts. First it's the I-hate-you-but-you-just-keep-coming-to-me kind of relationship which I really don't understand. I did not hate this drama like some people do, I also do not LOVE this drama either. I think it's a drama to watch if you have a lot of free time and nothing to do(preferably in the summer).Acting/Cast: First off, I don't feel the two leads have much chemistry between each other, at all. Jung So Min acted her character well but it's a very light drama, so then again you don't need to possess great talent to be able to act in Playful Kiss. Kim Hyun Joong was alright, I'm not a squealing fan girl for him because I haven't seen any dramas besides PK with him in it. Overall, the acting was alright, nothing actually stood out.Music: I watched this too long ago to remember the music. :/Re-watch value: Well, I typically don't re-watch dramas. I only re-watch if they are masterpieces like The Princess' Man. So giving this a 6 is a fair choice because there are some sweet funny moments that made me laugh.Overall: I wouldn't call this a terrible drama. You just need to have patience to watch it. I recommend this drama to people who just want a light drama to watch when they have nothing to do.","7","6.0","6.0","7.0","6.0","6.0"
"Naye","I liked the first episodes, the main female character made me laugh a lot and I found cute some parts, but then the story started to be unbearable for me. Does Oh Hani have any self-respect? pride? It doesn't seem so. Seung Jo was REALLY MEAN to her but she was there showing her sick love for him anyways. No chemistry between characters. Horrible example of romance (treat the female as shit, she'll be happy if you kiss her anyways). Kim Hyun Joong have the same facial expression (poker face)  every single episode.I couldn't even finish it.","7","4.0","3.0","3.5","9.0","1.0"
"dapinaymrs","And to think this drama got me into the wonderful world of Kdrama. *Hides face in palms, shakes head and groans mentally*Yes, this drama launched Kim Hyun Joong into notable fame in SE Asia (and other parts of the world, I presume) as a follow-up role from Boys Over Flowers (how our hearts bled for Ji Hoo). He is, in this series--Baek Seung Jo, a genius who is the object of affection--or should we say obsession--of Oh Ha Ni.If you've done any research on this story, you might have taken note that it's based off the manga 'Itazura na Kiss.' As I became increasingly irritated by Oh Ha Ni's blind devotion to Baek Seung Jo, I tried to search for the original story and check if there were any deviation from it. Surprisingly, there were NONE. And if there were, they were minuscule and hardly noticeable.Ah but even if Jung So Min acted so naturally, she could have been so much more. And Kim Hyun Joong...I don't even want to go there.Story - you can live without itRewatch value - are you kidding me?","8","6.0","5.0","7.0","8.0","3.0"
"LMHftw","Story:This story was very funny and interesting. It was the first time I had ever seen something so absurd when it came to love. I found it interesting and was always wondering what will happen in the next episode. It was a fluffy and cute type of drama. However, I will admit the storyline was pretty simple... a girl chasing someone she loves fullstop. There wasn't really any interesting history or big secret or anything in this drama.Acting/Cast:Kim Hyun Joong is a great person... but he can't act. I wouldn't have even been able to tell he liked her. Ever. In my whole life. He had no emotions, whatsoever. Occasionally when he flashed his cute mouse smile it made me think he did have emotions... but yeah that was about it. Jung So Min was pretty alright, I guess she made up for Kim Hyun Joong being so bland, because she was pretty crazy. The second male lead... Bong Joon Gu. Oh my goodness. So annoying. He was so annoying. However I have to admit he kinda made the drama a bit funnier.Music:The music from this drama is nice. It doesn't really leave a huge impression on me. One of the songs from this OST may come up in my iTunes library occasionally and I think 'oh this is from playful kiss'... but it never really makes me want to go and watch the drama again.Rewatch?Of course! Although the acting isn't that great and the story is pretty simple, it is a nice, fun drama to watch. Even if Kim Hyun Joong can't act that well, he is still good to look at for 16hours.Overall:It is still one of those dramas that a Korean drama addict should watch because it is quiet popular. It won't pull any heartstrings but it will make you laugh. It is a light and fun drama to watch.","8","8.0","8.0","7.0","8.0","9.0"
"poloalduchili","I have a soft spot for this one. Everyone kept telling me how the Taiwanese version was supposedly better but I never managed to get past how ugly and stupid the girl looks in it.In this Korean version of the manga, both lead are actually hot: Oh Ah Ni is silly but cute as hell and Baek Seung Ju is just... Well I never thought myself as a masochist until Playful Kiss!The best part of this drama is definitely the two leads, Baek Seung Ju being a selfish arrogant son of a *, horribly frustrating on top of being freakishly hot (not to mention that this role was just PERFECT for Kim Hyun Joong) and Ah Ni so cute and adorable in her misery and gullibility...But overall it is actually quite childish and the supporting roles are often really annoying  (when re-watching it, I always skip those parts) so don't expect something too perfect. I think the drama was stopped before it could run its course and that is why they made the special episodes that are actually the rest of the manga and as important as the rest since for once you get to see what happens AFTER the happy ending.Now PK makes the top 5 for me because of the intensity of the chemistry and tension between the two leads (so important when watching a romance drama) but others might consider it too childish. In any case, it is still a very good one for school/romance/comedy fans.","8","9.0","10","10","8.0","8.0"
"pinkduck89","I wanted to love this show. I mean Boys over Flowers is one of my guilty pleasures that I love watching over and over, but this is nowhere close to that kind of quality. Horribly written with lines that make you groan and feel queasy from sheer cheesiness. The main lead is whiny and annoying and honestly more than a little bit of a stalker. Kim Hyun Joong reprises his role as Jihoo only more of a jerk and less emotional, which I honestly didn't think was possible. His character here makes Jihoo look like a fountain of expression. Honestly, save yourself some time and just watch BoF again.","11","3.0","2.0","4.0","5.0","1.0"
"Sylvia","After watching the Japanese version, it's about time I rewatched the Korean one. God, why did I even decide to do this.As I commented on the Japanese version, I really hate the plot. Ha Ni states she's loved Seung Jo for years even though she's never talked to him. Yeah, that's completely normal if you ask me. Seriously, she's so shallow because she loves him only for his looks in my opinion, considering they haven't even talked to each other before. But of course that's true love. It cannot not be true.Seung Jo, the cold-hearted jerk. However, now that I've watched the Japanese version, I got to admit that Seung Jo has more human emotions and reactions to him than Naoki. The latter is just emotionless and souless while Seung Jo shows his feelings quite often. Well, at least he tries to show them. Kim Hyeon Jung's acting is so bad that we can't really read anything from his facial expressions besides the usual poker face. And he insults Ha Ni less than Naoki insults Kotoko. But he's still a jerk as he sometimes gives Ha Ni false hopes, making her believe that he might actually be interested in her. And I swear he has a multiple personality disorder mixed with mood swings. Say what you want, but that shiet ain't normal.Now, moving on to stupid Ha Ni who deserves all this emotional mess as a punishment for her stupidity.First of all, oh my fcking God, I don't know if it's the actress's habit, or if she just wanted to make Ha Ni seem cute, but I hated it when she sticked out her tongue, slightly biting on it. Like Jesus fckign Christ, what the hell is that supposed to be? Girl, you're not cute so stop. Stop it before I cut your tongue off.Basically, Ha Ni is an imbecile with a soft-headed expression on her face. Well, at least she has some facial expressions, unlike particular someone. Though a miracle has happened because Ha Ni is less of a pain in the aß than Kotoko. But still not bearable.Also, I hated the relationship between Ha Ni and Bong Jun Gu in this version. In the Japanese version, Kotoko and Kinnosuke are good friends, so it's understandable why he's fallen for her. However, in this version, Jun Gu seems like a creepy stalker who just won't leave Ha Ni alone even though he's clearly a burden to her. Seems like Korea is afraid of showing a friendly skinship between a male and a female friends. As if boys and girls couldn't be just friends who aren't afraid of touching each other in a friendly manner.As for the relationship between Baek Seung Jo and Yun He Ra, I just want to say that Ha Ni needs to get her shiet together and stop being a jealous moron. It's none of her business who he's dating considering the guy she ""loves"" shows no interest in here. So girl, stop trying to ruin his good relations with He Ra just because you're overly obsessed with the guy.Do I even have to mention that the ending is so out of place and awkward?And I laughed so hard at the script writers for desperately trying to give Bong Jun Gu some consolation. But I appreciate their good intentions though.Overall, don't watch this drama, it's horrible.Seriously just don't do it.","7","1.0","1.0","3.0","5.0","1.0"
"0003423asfsas","Okay so I wasn't overly impressed on this version of Itazura na Kiss at all.There was only one thing I liked about it which was the soundtrack as it went pretty well to the entire drama.The things I honestly didn't like the most was that;1. The acting was bad, as they didn't seem realistic enough to the parts they played like you know when acting is good because when it gets to a heart feeling part it either makes you cry or you get sudden butterflies, you know? I never had any of those feelings between the two main characters.2. They missed out on the best parts of the Manga. (not going to spoil which parts so if you haven't seen it and you watch it and you've already read the manga before you'll understand what I mean).3. The actors could not get into their character's personalities, as for example the J vers of Naoki Irie was a lot better as he could relate really well to the character as he did the same major in university as Naoki did and had the same attitude he did and also looked overall like an actual genius,  with the character from this story he didn't look smart and a well known genius so it made the part look really poor and bad.& 4. The actors they also picked looked nothing alike to the manga version as that is probably not as important to some people but to me it is, I mean if they looked somewhat similar i would of been somewhat more satisfied on that part but nope they looked nothing alike whatsoever which was highly disappointing for me considering I'm a huge manga geek and I've read Itazura na Kiss that many times I've lost count.But overall I was highly disappointed in this drama, I would not recommend it to anyone.","3","1.0","1.0","1.0","5.5","1.0"
"Gina911","So....I am very new to this Kdrama genre and I am quickly getting into.  Thank you Netflix.This is obviously a teenage or young adult type drama but I am sucker for great love stories no matter what age group.  I am always the one cheering for the underdog.  The one girl or guy that is out of place and no one expects to win but does.  With that being said.. What the heck is wrong here?I could not stand the way Ha Ni stalked this guy.  He was sooooo mean to her.  He received great pleasure and joy in making her feel bad.  He acknowledge that.  He even acknowledge that to her.  She admits that he is mean but still is madly in love with him.  I don't understand.I watched Good Morning Call and I thought that was bad and no one could possibly be as bad as Nao but boy was I wrong.  Ha Ni has her beat hands down.  I got up to episode 10 and I honestly could not stomach it anymore.  Many times I found myself wanting to through something at the TV or just picking up the TV and smashing it because I couldn't stand it.I want to apologize for not understanding the culture being that I am American.  I am not sure if this type of drama is a representation of how Asian women are in real life.  I cannot understand how any person man or female would allow someone to be blatantly mean and rude to them and find that they are the person that they would want to spend their life with.  It baffles me quite frankly.  The few dramas that I have seen seem to portray the lead actress as weak, dumb and clumsy.  She is has a servant attitude and is ok with made to feel beneath and should show gratitude for them even getting attention.I am not familiar with the actors like everyone else seems to be so I really have no point of reference to their acting abilities.The friends I found unnecessary.  They really did not add anything to this show especially when they got to college.  No one else seemed to have a life outside of Ha Ni.I found the mother's enthusiasm for the relationship a little bizarre and a bit going overboard.Ha Ni is very pretty.  HOWEVER, I hated the way they made her look like an idiot 11 year old even while in college.  They way she dressed and combed her hair.  I understand she was supposed to be pure and fresh and different but does that also mean she has to look like a child?  Realistically, would a normal guy really find this attractive for a long period of time?  And I don't even want to get into her stalking.  I got so annoyed when every time you turn around, she is running after him like a puppy and messes up everything.  What is worse is that he knew about everything all of this time and he showed little sign of changing.  He tortured her and she just kept coming back for more.I have to end here.  Even just writing the review is making me upset and I do not want to break my laptop.","3","1.0","1.0","1.0","3.0","1.0"
"JADE1300","Just as I don't understand why HEART STRINGS did not get higher reviews and higher ratings in Korea when it did so well internationally,  I don't understand why so many people like this drama PLAYFUL KISS.   It's got to be the worst drama ever.  I really tried to get into it and like it, but it just did not have any redeemng qualities.  Not even to watch Kim Hyun Joong, whom I adored in BOY'S OVER FLOWERS.  He was sooo swoon worthy there, cutting the food for  the girl!!! I mean who does that???  However, in this drama, he was just a total jerk from the get go.  I tried to make it through High School and hope that every one matures in college and something sparks between the main couple, but it just dragged on with the male lead being a total ass and the female lead just being a rug with no backbone and no self-esteem.   I just hope young girls don't follow her example.  Wasted my time, so much better dramas to watch.","6","1.5","1.0","2.0","1.0","1.0"
"Dramagirl4ever","This drama has a light and delicate plot.If you think about the plot in depth then its kind of creepy:-A high school girl has an obsession over one boy for 3-4 years.- And stalks him (in a super cute way!)But, that was the great joy of this cute drama. I liked how Oh Ha Ni has/had an honest and pure love.Kim hyun joong's acting was great as always :) His hair and smile are eye catching in this drama.Oh Ha Ni was adorable. Her outfits are to die for!I personally really liked this drama because i could relate to it because it has:-the foreigner that falls for a handsome Korean boy (my dream)-the snobby, extremely handsome, and smart boy that all the girls want  -Oh Ha Ni the girl who is never noticed ( like me! haha)Once you start this drama you won't be able to put it down.

"Hira-M","How I came across the drama: I have seen Itazura na Kiss (anime) and I have loved Kim Hyun Joong for a very long time (since I first saw him in Gummy's MV for As A Man) so when I came to know that Itazura na Kiss had a drama with Kim Hyun Joong in it, I was more than excited to watch it. But I had my expectations low, because as much as I love Kim Hyun Joong, I don't like the story of Itazura na Kiss that much.Story: Even so, I loved the story of the drama! They changed it a little from the anime and I'm so glad they did. Because they removed the stupid plot holes and made it more interesting.Acting and Characters: Kim Hyun Joong did a really great job playing Seung Jo. I hated Ikki (in the anime). It was like he was just using Kotoko, that he didn't really love her. He was just afraid that no one else would love him like she did so he held on to her. And he bullied her way too much. And Kotoko was just waayy too stupid. She got on my nerves. I seriously wanted to slap her hard, then maybe she would've come to her senses. But in the drama, I could see that even though Seung Jo bullied Oh Ha Ni sometimes, he really did love her. And Jung So Min did a good job in playing Ha Ni too because she wasn't as annoying as the anime character (I use ""as annoying"" because girls who desperately run after guys who obviously don't care about them will always be annoying to me). I felt really sorry for Bong Joon Gu! He was more likable than the anime character, and I seriously would've been OK if Ha Ni would've ended up with him. I felt like giving the poor guy a hug. The other characters were nice too but not very memorable. Except Seung Jo's mom. I loved her in the anime and I loved her in the drama too. She was really funny and sweet.Romance: I loved the romance! It was so sweet and nice. I loved seeing Seung Jo's feelings progress. I loved his secret smiles (I ? Kim Hyun Joong's smile)! I especially loved how he was so jealous when Ha Ni was with someone else. It showed that he really did care.Negatives: I don't really have much negatives to point out because I really loved this show. Though there was this one character (I don't remember his name) who was involved with Ha Ni. He had a fight with Bong Joo Gu in the library. But he only appeared for a couple of episodes. I wonder where he disappeared to..Favorite Scene: I have so many favorite scenes, I couldn't possibly list them all over here! But I'll still share a few. Well the first one was when Seung Jo saves Ha Ni from the naked man :P I loved the rain scene! (Who doesn't?!) The balcony scene was the sweetest scene ever! When Seung Jo kisses Ha Ni in the forest when she's asleep ? When they are on their honeymoon and Seung Jo tickles Ha Ni to make her smile (when she's mad at him). And the list goes on...After Marriage: I loved the YouTube specials in which they showed their life after marriage. But I loved 'Seung Jo's Diary' (also on YouTube) more because those showed how much he loved Ha Ni and it was really a peep into his shy soul.All in all: I really loved this drama and if you're into Romantic Comedies you should definitely watch it!","5","8.0","8.0","8.0","7.0","7.0"
"foxx-rain","I LOVE PLAYFUL KISS. If you search the net, there are a lot of people who did not like this drama because of Oh Ha Ni. I admit that she follows Baek Seung Jo around and some might find her annoying, but I find that she acts her age. She's not vindictive, and truly comes off as a kind and loyal person. I loved this drama from the first time I watched it, and when I watched it again, I only loved it more because I noticed some subtle things I didn't notice the first time.Also, I've watched the anime, Itazura na Kiss and I've read most of the volumes of the manga - there is a lot of stuff I wish we could have seen with Playful Kiss!

"darkgarden88","I love this drama! It's my number one favorite drama of all time! I've watched several dramas since this one, but none of them can compare to Playful Kiss. It was sweet, heartwarming, and full of charm. I laughed, and I cried. (I cried both tears of sadness and joy.) I was actually surprised with myself when I cried with Yoon He Ra and Bong Joon Gu. I wasn't expecting to feel  bad for these two, but when they cried, I couldn't help but cry with them. I love Kim Hyun Joong and Jung So Min! They fit into their roles perfectly, and with such ease - the way their characters interacted felt very natural.The only thing I didn't like was *where* it ended. Don't get me wrong, the ending was great! I just meant that I wish there was a second season - there's still more to the story. I really, really, *really* wanted to see Baek Seung Jo get jealous. (Hehe) I also wanted to see Oh Ha Ni in medical school. I really~ wanted to see the story continue.Other than that, I give this drama a perfect 10.","5","10","10","10","10","10"

"nikhapi","I am actually a fan of the manga where it taken the story from so me liking this series is expected. First of, I was never really into with the whole remaking stuffs so it took me awhile to finally watch this! Secondly, I was also a fan of the second live-action adaptation of the manga so I kinda skeptical if I will really give my time to finally sit down and watch this. So one fine day when I'm feeling like a lost puppy looking for one lost love I decided to give this a try. And I'm really glad I watched this coz it's not bad afterall! I love how light the atmosphere and how beatiful it was shot! Love the chemistry between the leading actors.About the acting aspect, Kim Hyun Joong is not the best actor out there but his role in this drama make him believable unlike his former role in BOF. The role fits his character. As for the rest.. All I can say they did a wonderful job! I think many of this drama viewers did not like the way Hana stalks/love Baek like she doesn't have a life at all but if you follow the manga, she's really like that!Overall, it's a must watch to people who likes watching young romance.","5","7.0","10","6.0","7.0","8.0"

I can't stand that boy she chases after. He is boring and a total dick. I don't understand what is so great about him. The story is god awful, the characters are horrible except for some of the supporting cast and overall I just hated this. The first episode was great but after that it all just goes to hell.

"maymaymaymay","Out of all the KDramas I've seen that have labeled themselves as rom-coms, ""Playful Kiss"" is the only one I've seen that successfully lives up to that title. It's a cute, breezy watch with a light story and average acting (probably less that average on Kim Hyun-Joong's part). I only watched this because it was a remake of the anime, and I wasn't particularly expecting much. That being said, this drama didn't exceed or fall short of those expectations. It hit them and stayed there.Most people think that Baek Sung-Jo was a overly cold character. I think that coldness came more from Hyun-Joong's acting than from the writers themselves, so I can ignore it. Besides, the character has the same personality in all versions of this drama. That's kind of his personality...I appreciated that part about all the characters. They were all fleshed out differently, and had their unique combinations of flaws and virtues. None of the characters in ""Playful Kiss"" were like the typical KDrama characters.Music: The music here was fitting for the overall tone. Upbeat and full of energy, it helped set the tone of this show. It fit very nicely overall with the series, and made me smile every time one of the songs came on.Overall, this drama was an easy watch. Even if you skimmed through it, the story wouldn't be impacted. It was fun to watch, and a nice attempt at remaking a classic manga, but it was difficult to take seriously.","4","7.0","8.0","7.0","8.0","6.0"

I liked his acting in the BOF however in this drama his acting was really poor and bcuz of that i hated the main character and the k-drama. After i watched the anime version i dont hate the main male lead (Naoki) that much. KHJ couldnt convey the anime/mangas character very well, didnt capture the depth of the original character and made it seem plain arrogant and thats it, compared to anime version.

My opinion is that seung jo doesn't deserve ha ni, these was hardly no romance between these two. Bits and pieces hardly. I'm sitting here like, let some Btch talk to me like that, let some guy treat me like that, I'd quit the tennis club if I was her. Nothing made sense in the end, he treated her like garbage. Even if that was supposed to be in ""personality"".-spoilers  don't read if you haven't watched the end-The eposide when she got married to seung joke he took her on a honey moon, he let this women hang on him and walked with her. What the hell was that I was so mad I never been so mad about a show. Then when they get home and go to school he meets the girl he was seeing before he decided to marry ha ni. He walks away from his unofficial wife and let's this girl hang off him.In conclusion it wasn't all bad I liked it, but yknow it wasn't great either.

She is whiney and weak and clingy and just...unable to function without the approval of a guy who throughout the entire series (even after they get together) treats her like crap.

"2hyun Polaris","Almost every korean drama fan seemed to have Playful Kiss on their top ten drama list,when i checked Youtube.so i got pretty excited to watch it.the beginning was really funny and all,but Baek Seung Jo and Oh Ha Ni had absolutely no chemistry.after around episode 8 the story wasn't even funny anymore,it just kept dragging.Plus, Oh Ha Ni was too embarassing to watch.really!i was disappointed and annoyed with the characters.","7","3.0","4.0","5.0","8.0","1.0"
"manicmuse","I am surprised that I liked this drama as much as I did, because I usually can't stand stupid female leads. Jung So Min is so cute that she made her character very likable, in spite of her pitiful behavior. Kim Hyun Joong plays cold/arrogant really well, and I couldn't help liking his character too (his smile is killer!). Together they had an awkward chemistry that I think worked really well. I  also liked the supporting cast of family, friends, and rivals, but Wang Kyung Soo was distracting because he couldn't possibly pass for 21 years old. Lee Tae Sung's Oh Ha Ni-obsessed character was annoying at first, but eventually he started to grow on me, and I was impressed by how different he was from his character in ""Romance Zero"". I absolutely loved the mom as well, who was definitely one of my favorite characters. I started to miss the band after a while too... : )This show basically is about stalking, so if you don't find stalking cute/romantic, then you will probably hate this drama. It takes the opposites attract theory to the extreme, but as the story progressed their relationship started to make more sense. I haven't seen the other versions, or read the manga, so I can't compare it. I wouldn't call Playful Kiss one of my favorites, but it is worth watching.*beware of fan commenting, especially if you are unfamiliar with the story, because they end up spoiling everything!*","3","7.0","7.0","8.0","6.0","5.0"
"Maqluba","I came into this drama without seeing the Taiwanese version and without knowing any of the actors (except for falling for secondary OTP in boys before flowers with KHJ). I have no bias towards KHJ other than the guy sure can make your heart skip a beat when he smiles :)I have to say this drama is a hate/love one for most who watch it and I fall in the LOVE side. The things that bugged me in the first 2 episodes quickly got fixed/removed (like her daydreams) and from then on I was hooked. This drama has a very lighthearted and BASIC story line people so don't expect great turmoil and over the top romance. Its a simple love story that can truly happen..no crazy twists that make you go ""only on TV"".What really hooks me in this drama is the cute/embarrassing moments that happen to Oh Ha Ni that make me cringe and giggle and hide behind my blanket for her sake. I love love that feeling in rom-coms and this drama has so many of them!! Jung So Min plays Oh Ha Ni so perfectly, if it weren't for her I'm sure I wouldn't have continued on with the drama.I love a good drama like everyone else but I love me some silly too and this drama does silly without being stupid-silly (a fine fine line that's usually crossed making me drop a drama). It may seem crazy from our point of view that this girl is non-stop stalking our poor Baek Seung Jo but just when you think she's going too far, she holds back and restrains herself and just when you think she's gonna get over him, he shows her signs of hope and she's back to her obsession again.I know a lot of people seem to hate it for the silliness and some people can't seem to get over the differences in PK versus ISWAK but all I can say is if silly bugs you and if normalcy bugs you then this drama may not be for you. I think its because I like J-dramas so much for the silliness and this drama was supposedly a straight adaptation of a Japanese manga that I am used to and enjoy that silliness. If you didn't like ISWAK don't ignore this drama because I couldn't watch past 4 episodes of ISWAK (I tried so many many times but I can't get over how weak the female character is in that one) and I still love this drama.","3","8.0","8.0","9.0","8.0","10"
"cynthia","I'm gonna be honest and say that this drama was cute, but it's plot was just the same as Mischievous Kiss and every other cheesy drama. I didn't really see their chemistry? Like Hani pissed me off in every episode because she was so weak and dependent. There was no character development except on Seungjo's part. Plus I think Hani's stalking is just downright creepy. I'm wondering if Seungjo ever got a moment of privacy to himself after he met Hani. Overall it was okay but I didn't like it. Seungjo's mom was the only character I enjoyed.","2","4.0","3.0","5.0","6.5","1.0"

I never read the manga, didn't watch the anime and I don't feel like watching any other adaption of this story. The special episodes released were pretty stupid too. So why did I like it? Who knows ... It's about falling in love and being hurt by the one you love ... and never giving up on love ... sigh ... somehow it was touching and I started rooting for the girl ...","2","8.0","7.0","7.0","7.0","7.0"

She was so dumb!Her lack of common sense was amazing...The main guy was just a douche. But his mom was quite sweet.I'm amazed by the acting. They were so good that I hate their characters now.Music?

"kpopx3lover","This drama never bore me to death from the very beginning. Although it did get me irritated because of how Oh Ha Ni followed Baek Seung Jo around. She seemed like a stalker and it got me really irritated but I never stopped watching. As I continued to watch the drama it made me realize that Oh Ha Ni was a much better and stronger person than how she was in the beginning. You can tell that as the drama goes on, the characters change in their own way. Baek Seung Jo who was always cruel and criticized stupid people became more caring and learned to love Ha Ni. Ha Ni who was immature and childish turns into a hardworking and strong person. Even though she was often hurt because of Baek Seung Jo, she would always put on a happy face. She kinda inspired me in a way. In the end *****SPOILER ALERT***** she got into college, got into nursing school, and even got her man. It just shows that working hard pays off. I really loved this drama and it was super duper cute! Best version and one of the best dramas ever! PLAYFUL KISS FIGHTING <3333","3","10","10","10","8.0","9.0"

"Keurinibae","Another one of the very first Korean dramas I watched was this one, and it had me laughing from the start. Perhaps I shouldn't have at times, but the absurdity of some situations for the leads was just too funny to pass up. Kim Hyun Joong was a surprise and welcome male lead.The story itself was interesting to me. The leads couldn't have been more opposite if it killed them, yet the hidden intrigue the male lead seemed to have at having someone that optimistic following him around got me. Regardless of the shenanigans Oh Ha Ni get herself into countless times, and got Baek Seung Jo dragged into as well, her personality and Baek Seung Jo's cool exterior made the show never dull to watch. I have watched Playful Kiss several times over, and will continue to do so because it is one of my favorites.","3","10","10","10","10","10"
"Emmers","At first I kept comparing this to ISWAK, but after awhile I stopped. The feel of the two series is completely different. Both have strengths and weaknesses. No use comparing.I started watching this because after seeing Kim Hyun Joong in Boys Before Flowers I was curious about what he'd be like in other shows. I think I like him a lot better in this. He's a lot less stiff and he smiles more (which makes him even better looking than normal... just wish they had skipped the perm he has in the middle ^_^). I also really liked Jung So Min as Oh Ha Ni. She had great chemistry with her leading man and managed to play the part without getting to the annoying point.I also liked most of the supporting cast. Ha Ni's friends were great. Joon Gu annoyed me at first but got better as the show went on. The parents were a bit over the top at times, but the cute moments made up for it. Seung Jo's little brother was great. And I LOVED the band Bye Bye Sea as Joon Gu's posse. Awesome!Even though the storyline was kinda cheesy and predictable, it was done in an interesting, cute, and funny way. I loved all the little subtle moments with Seung Jo letting his guard down and showing how much he liked Ha Ni. Overall, a really great show! ^_^","3","8.0","8.0","9.0","8.0","7.0"

"Fiona","Story- No plot whatsoever, but if I enjoy the story I'll watch it, if you are looking for plot this drama is not right for you. Just a girl living with her crush and hoping for a chance with obstacles along the way.Characters- This is the weakest point of the story. I don't mind if the characters are cold or ignorant, because it makes the story interesting, but NOOOOO this drama lacks development. The protagonist is in a very delusional world, but she is very determined. The guy is similar to a typical Korean Drama Male lead, cold and bad at saying ""I love you and such."" The minor characters are the only good ones.Realism- I added this for people who want a nice realistic and Slice Of Life kind of story. This drama is the MOST UNREALISTIC drama EVER. The girl has a crush like lots of people. But she manages to squeeze through spots that just shows us viewers how we can make it if we try our best. Its a good message but is too much considering her delusional way if thought.Romance- I believe this may be the strongest point of the story, even some of them are just emotionless. But I don't want to give any spoilers.Sound- This is the second strongest point of the drama. The it's is pretty good, light hearted, love, and sad all in the song.Enjoyment- Before I can say anything. I like dramas where I can enjoy something, laugh, and does not care for any plot. This drama ruined it. My enjoyment was mostly frustrated. The girl has no common sense. The minor characters do a better job. The guy apparently has no flaws and is just a piece of paper that's perfect in every way. 1/10This drama is for- People who want a pretty lighthearted and cute drama. And can handle the characters.This drama is NOT for- Slice Of Life people and if you have Second Male Lead syndrome or prefer the nicer guys. Don't watch it.","1","3.5","2.5","2.5","8.0","1.0"
"Rian","I really enjoyed this drama, it was funny, with a lot of silliness and foolish behavior, the story wasn't credible, the series did not portray some romantic real life happenings, but I guess that is why I enjoyed it so much!If you are looking for something relaxing and you're aren't concerned with how a show usually tries to make the story a tad bit credible, than this drama will be to your fancy!The whole script is fairy-tale like, an impenetrable handsome, smart and charming prince and the ugly duckling, silly, baka, but honest and with true innocent love for the prince.If one were to over-think this drama, sure the female character would be considered clingy, a simpleton with no self esteem and will or pride, but the show is not a slice-of-life, it just overly conveys the idea that the characters are fairy tale depictions ( as suggested from the very first few minutes of the show, with her chasing the unicorn).I loved the characters interaction, I loved the lengths to which the female lead went to show her love and support, I really enjoyed the story development and the silly comedy, the supporting cast was extremely good, especially the mother and her 2 best friends, and I loved how the series was just so well rounded, with a great  ending and and awesome character evolution.It isn't a life changing drama, but it gets you to laugh and forget about real life worries, intricate problems or what-nots.","3","8.0","8.0","8.0","7.0","7.0"

"Tajo Mahcts","-This was my first ever drama, and it is the PERFECT place to start.-While playful kiss cannot necessarily be confined to the category of ""family drama"", the family aspects in it were amazing, maybe even my favorite part.-The friendships were double plus amazing, this is the part that will seriously have you walking away with your heart so full. So, coming from someone with Synesthesia, the friendships in this drama and the word warm just fit together like two perfect puzzle pieces in my mind.-The humor probably was my favorite part, Playful Kiss is full of the awkward, cringe-inducing humor that has you screaming inside ""ERMAGERSH, THAT IS SO ME!"" (Wait, nobody else did that? That was just me? Oh. Well it made me cry of laughter anyway.)-WARNING: The story will make you hurt though. Personally, it made my heart turn over so many times, not because it's tragic or anything like that, but because of the decisions of the main characters. You just wanna go in there and grab 'em by the shoulders and wholup them around a bit sometimes.-Great plot though, always full of ridiculous antics, always had you playing the next episode before the preview of it at the end of the last episode began.

"Aquamaraqua","I think if you go into this drama with no expectations, it will surprise you. I have not read the manga, but I have watched other adaptations of this drama. And while I enjoy the Japanese remake better, this drama has a special place in my heart and has its own special aura.The story is straight forward and somewhat cliche, and the acting isn't over the top or remarkable either, but there's a heart in this drama that will make you want to root for the girl. It's a perfect drama to watch as a teenager. I'd have to disagree with some reviews claiming that it showed Oh Hani, the main girl, as senseless. I think it actually depicted somewhat realistically just how swept up some teenagers can get in love interests, that it becomes the whole world to them, but they come to realize that adulthood has many aspects and finding romance is just one of them. Of course the cold male lead ridiculing the young girl is not something anyone wants to support, but this drama doesn't justify him being an asshole either. It instead does show character development and a budding romance between the two leads. I felt like the nearly robotic way the male lead portrayed himself in the beginning wasn't something that deviated out of character, and instead was portrayed fine.One review said that the mom was helping Oh Hani stalk her own son: well they two leads are living in the same house, it's hard to be depicted as a stalker when you are residing in the same place in all honesty. The mom is actually one of the best reasons to watch this drama. She does want the two to get together because she's always longed for a daughter, but she isn't forceful and doesn't get in the way of the relationship either. It was refreshing to see a Kdrama mum be all over the female lead instead of being against her.Overall this drama is worth dipping your toes into at least once. I found a special spark this drama had, if you don't feel it that's fine, but it definitely is worth looking into.","1","9.0","9.0","8.5","9.0","10"
"Tamya Maragh","I have watched most of all the adaptations for this drama and here are reasons...I did not like it at all what so ever.1. I don't like it how the main female was portrayed she wasn't even that dumb or stupid like she was suppose to be at all. Plus, she wasn't even that obsessed with him at all either.2. Kim Hyun Joong's acting was terrible. he didn't suit playing noaki at all because he wasn't even a little bit that cold to her compared to the other verisons. I don't know if it was because I was to in love with the japanese anime at the time,but he didn't do it justice at all.3. The girl who was playing Hae Ra was suppose to play either Sahoko or Naoki's fiance,but they for some reason decided it was a great idea to combine both the character and make her play both. Instead of getting another actress to play the other character like the rest of the versions which was to me lazy.4.The story was too rushed all the scenes was all over the place and it was hard for me to keep up. When some of the scenes didn't happen in their correct order like in the anime,so it left me confused. Also, their was some unnecessary scenes like when Hani got mad at baek seungjoo and left the house,but later admitted her fault and came back home. Waste of time5.It didn't stay true to the original or at least try. Their was also not enough comedy in it, it was like watching a sad documentary in school where just are not supposes to laugh or get you entertained.","0","3.5","2.0","4.0","4.0","4.0"
"Happy101","Just to start off this drama is just sad. Not going to lie I hated the male lead. 1 The female lead bothers me so she’s so mad in love with a guy that she doesn’t care about her future she’s failing all her class. I hate the male lead okay why is he do rude al least give her a little attention. This shows has a cycle first she’s goes to him and says she’s loves him then she try’s something to make him love her he doesn’t care of gets annoying then she swears not to love him he does something she does it again. You could skip episodes not minutes episodes and still understand what’s happened happening. Her family doesn’t have a home right so you would think she would get a job to help her dad out right nope she gets a job to buy the guy clothes that’s just sad. Okay so she failing so how does she get into college explain to me she’s an F student she doesn’t care for herself at all or she’s would of stopped. She would of been like I need to fix my life I need to care about my future she never does that. He rarely shows affection for her even when they are dating. He treats her like trash and she always comebacks to him she never did anything good for herself she does everything for him and him only. He couldn’t care less about her this show is so annoying I absolutely hate this drama I only continued and finshed it because I thought he would become kind but nope that never happens she lets herself get treated like trash how sad.","0","4.0","3.5","2.5","7.0","2.5"
"ErinHudson","This is the first Kdrama I watched and it got me into kdramas althought it is clearly lacking alot. The acting was ok and the story doesn't really have a lot of substance. Theres alot of randomness in this show that doens't really fit. The main problem I had was with the main characters. Oh Ha Ni was just too desperate and thirsty. She seriously was a stalker and had no self-respect. She did everything based on Baek Seung Jo. Then Baek Seung Jo was just really mean. I didn't really buy their love story. He showed hardly any interest in her almost all the way to the end. Still, it is enjoyable in it's own way. If you just want to sit and watch something without thinking too much this is for you.

"kdramabinger","I do not want to write a long review for this as I would pretty much not like to waste any more time on it.After beating around the bush for a good amount of 1 year, I finally decided to give this show a go. What started off as a good experience, left me agitated for having to waste 16 precious hours of my life I probably won't ever get back.What I disliked about this was the fact that there was whatsoever NO character development for the main leads, especially Jung So Min's character. The woman remained a spoiled child to the very end. Every character went through a good transformation and even signs of positive transformation were seen for Kim Hyun Joong's character. But they just probably forgot that the actress needs to mature with age so as a compensation added her career dream in the last second episode.I hated how she had next to none self respect. The fact that she relentlessly pursued the lead with no ounce of dignity was annoying to a murderous rage. Despite the cold treatment by Baek Seung Jo and after crying for like 15 seconds, she went back to being a rug for the main lead.I have never seen such a weak female lead in any show and it enrages me that she was shown as a support to the male lead's career aspirations.I could have easily given it a miss had I known the show continued her childishness to the very end.","0","6.0","6.5","6.0","8.0","1.0"

It actually gave me some ideas of how to get closer to my crush. It was like I wanted to be her. Literally her life was really amazing. I really wanted it. This drama is funny in all sorts of ways. That is because of the wonderful lead actress. Plus there are so many other things. Like how there are always other girl wanting the extremely good looking guy. Trust me there is a lot of that in here. The only thing I didn’t like was how Oh Hani tried to act cute. idk, it just didn’t look good. It doesn’t suit her face. I also didn’t like the way her hair was styled. But, they did try to make this drama like how the Anime was. So they only did that to get the details of the anime. But, yeah you should watch this.

I was ok with it first, but then she always followed him which was getting creepy asf.3) SeungJo mom.Most of the time I like her because I also want Hani and Seungjo to be with each other. But then what kind of mother follows their son around and takes photos of them? She is sticking her nose into his business too much!4) Hani doesn't have any prideHow can Hani still like Seungjo after discriminating her and hurting her so badly. She forgives him so quickly. E.g. After SeungJo hurt Hani he doesn't apologize, instead she makes her smile, then cut to next scene.But again it's just a drama, it isn't suppose to feel real///EDIT:I watched the special episodes, they are so cute and funny.

"Soula","Soooo I watched Playful Kiss because I absolutely LOVE Itazura Na Kiss (the Japanese anime). I literally watched Itazura Na Kiss in ONE (1) night. I literally started at like 8pm and stayed up ALL NIGHT LONG to finish it because it just really captured me. I love how the story starts when they're in high school and ends with them as parents/adults with careers. Something about the story really clicks with me - the girl is deemed undesirable because of her (lack of) intelligence and lack of ""beauty"" and the male is overly desirable and completely unattainable because of his ""looks,"" intelligence, and wealth.This story is cliche and we all know how it ends. Many people actually hate this story because the female MC is treated so poorly by the male MC, but I just can't help but love it. I don't really feel that the male MC treated her in mean ways, I just don't think he was receptive to her advances. His behavior toward her and tenderness eventually show through in positive ways. And that's good enough for me.If you wanna talk about mean dudes, please watch She Was Pretty and then we can chat. I couldn't stomach how mean the male MC (in She Was Pretty) was toward the female MC, knowing that they would inevitably fall in love in the end, because he was just THAT mean to her. My heart would hurt for her and I just would not be happy for her when they got together in the end. If he could treat her that badly before he likes her, but then changes his attitude toward her so severely after they get together, it's just wrong. Especially if you think about how he treats others in that manner.For me, the male MC in Playful Kiss isn't anywhere near this severe in his treatment toward the female MC and so I'm not bothered or hurt and I'm actually happy for them in the end.I think Playful Kiss and the story of Itazura Na Kiss is something to take with a grain of salt and recognize that you might not be looking for a relationship like their's, but you can still appreciate their story.","0","6.5","7.5","7.0","6.0","5.0"
"Lisa","After watching this I liked it but it didn't live up to my expectations though. I felt that the acting wasn't the best and I just didn't really enjoy the chemistry between the two main characters. I felt that they could have done a lot better with the casting and done a better job at the plot. I've watched the other revisions from Japan and Taiwan and they were both pretty amazing in their own ways. They adapted but this was really just a lovesick girl. I thought that this adaptation could have done a lot better. With all that said I still watched it to the end and it was a good filler show to watch when I didn't have anything good to watch.","0","6.5","7.5","7.0","6.0","6.0"
"itsinesok","Ah~ Playful Kiss... Where do I start?First of all, I started watching this Drama because I read a fanfiction which was inspired by the Drama and I got curious. I loved the beginning but after a while I felt that it got really long and I stopped watching it for a while.But then after Episode 10 it got me again and I watched the last 6 episodes and cried so freaking much.It is a cute Drama and I really enjoyed it, but I am not sure if I am going to check out the Japanese and Thai version of it.Overall its a 9/10 for me because I laughed, cried and cringed with this Drama and that's everything a good Drama has to have for me.","0","9.0","9.0","9.0","10","7.0"

"pktljames","I saw this show early on in my drama watching and it was the first of the ""Itazura Na Kiss"" incarnations that I saw.  Honestly, after seeing most of the other versions (both Taiwanese and both Japanese versions) it's not my favorite version, but I do like it.Kim Hyun Joong plays the stoic and somewhat mean male lead well and Jung So Min's version of the female lead might be one of the better portrayals.  However, while I really do like this show, it's falls short mostly because it doesn't give the full story.  Since it stops just shortly into the marriage part of the story, you don't get to see the best parts of the story (in my opinion) which happen after the two characters are married.   For that reason, you don't get to see the full change in the male lead or the best transformation of the female lead either.That being said, the music is the best in this version and the production quality it probably the best of all the versions as well.  It's definitely worth watching.","0","9.0","9.0","9.5","9.0","9.5"
"Amna Hussain","If you're a person like me who values plot more than dramatics than this drama is not for you.Seung Jo is shown as a perfectionist excelling in everything he touches. It came to a point, that the viewers were led to believe that perhaps our male lead is God himself. Showing no flaw except for his mood swings made the character a bit unrealistic-Cooking ?-Swimming ?-Topping academics without ever studying ?-IQ 200?-Tennis champion?-Handling a business that you have no clue about?While Ha Ni is as stupid as she is cringey. Following or stalking a dude that has rejected her far more times than she could count. I personally dislike characters who have no ambitious callings or have their whole life naively rotating around people who don't seem to replicate any of that devotion back.Eung Jo is extremely rude to Ha Ni belittling her while Ha Ni's SO seems to give zero shits.The whole relation of those two is solely led by Seung Jo. He announces marriage without consulting Ha Ni, kisses her in challenge that she will not forget him even if she wishes too and then cutting contacts with her.However, this drama is under my recommendation if you come home extremely tired from work and need a mindless drama in which you don't have to process anything.","0","5.0","3.5","7.5","5.5","4.5"
"Omegawriter","A very heartwarming drama. I felt fresh every time I watched it. This was my first Korean drama I watched. I was unaware of such series, during my school days my friend suggested me to watch it. At first I felt weird to watch a drama which I can't understand. But with help of subtitles I started to love it. I loved the character of Seung jo's mother. Though I felt bad for the second leads, they too had a happy ending. On the whole it was an enjoyable series. I had fun while watching it and I don't get bored to watch it again.","0","9.5","8.5","9.0","9.5","10"
"Nico","We all have our guilty pleasures.Technically speaking I am not supposed to like this drama, I mean, how could I?Nothing meaningful ever happens, but I was completely won over by Jung So Min’s acting.She carries the drama on her shoulders from start to finish. I understand that many might question her choices of just blindly following Hyun Joong around but I think she’s just blinded by her love for him. I also like the impact she has on him and that he makes his decisions based on what she says without even realizing (he does later on).I take this bubbly, cotton candy drama for what it is, simple, fluffy and I really enjoyed myself watching it.","0","7.5","7.0","8.0","8.0","7.0"

"KdramaQueen89","Story- The high school episodes were funny. The college years were frustrating and some were a bore. The last couple episodes were super amazing. The end was cute. Even so, How the relationship develops between the leads is very strange. They go from being a no way in hell to very serious but without any real development in between. Thats why I cant give a higher score for the story.Acting/Cast- The leads did a great job in thier role. The actress that played Oh Ha Ni acted well as the immature stalkerish girl to a grown up person who knows what they want. I loved KHJ in BOF but disliked his character in PK. He did a great job acting as the snobby emotionless Baek Seung Jo. BSJ really got on my nerves though. He never showed enough emotion to Ha Ni which made thier relationship in the end really strange. Hated his character!! The supporting cast was funny and served thier purpose.Music- Some cool music nothing too in your face.Overall- Could have been written better but the end was a welcome surprise.","2","8.0","7.0","10","8.0","7.0"
"Triple-R-","This Drama was really gud. My friends kept pushing me to watch it but i kept delaying, but i must say i`m very impress with it. one of my favorite ending was episode 13 that kiss was awesome n the rain( the weather may always seem to b against her, but actually its with her) made it even better. i must say my playa game has improved for sure these girls wont survive my romantic assault after this show lol.I really luv the mother from the get go she was like another Oh ha ni, taking pictures every chance she gets and spreading gossips @ skool lol. the Window scenes where every nice, giving a look inside both characters and how they deal with situation they both face. I think the chemistry between the leads was very gud i had no prob with it. PLAYFUL KISS U DID GUD :)Anyway ppl this Drama is a definite watch ok it will have u LAUGHING :) sad :( but more LAUGHIN :)) i miss it already I want more plzzz","2","9.0","9.0","9.0","9.0","9.0"
"kawaiipotato_10","I really loved this show! It is such a drag but the way they presented this show is awesome .. I actually read its manga like 6 years ago and watched this kdrama in 2012 and I absolutely fell for this. Since I know this show has a drag , I didn't take it in a negative way. I just enjoyed the story, which I have read, since it has these amazing stars .. KIm Hyun Joong even though I found him asshole in the drama he was absolutely handsome!  Jung so Min is so kawaii!   It has no serious story like some big kdramas .. Its just a slice of life!And yes I have watched this like 8-9 times already..","1","9.0","8.0","9.0","9.0","9.0"

"rinsuzuki","The fact that the story was a little altered from which it was based (Itazura na Kiss) and the acting was not so satisfactorily done leave me partly disappointed.I can\'\'t help myself but to compare it to the original adaptation and the famous Taiwanese adaptation drama \""It Started With a Kiss\"". They are a lot better than Playful Kiss. Oh Hani was cute, I love the way she dresses ( even her hair style is cute) and she is so funny YET--in the drama parts,where we, as viewers, need to sympathies with her, are lacking. I can\'\'t feel the way she cries. I can say that the anime is a lot better (I cried and laugh a lot watching the anime adaptation).Anyway, I appreciate their efforts in making these. I bet they spend so big in the production cost, etc..but still, this can\'\'t beat the original.","1","7.0","6.0","6.0","7.0","4.0"
"swamilik","I can related to this story. However, the ending wasn''t the same as me lol.Coming back to the drama, the plot is the same old. It did kind of start to drag on in the end though. The acting by the female lead was much better than the acting by the male lead, but KHJ and his killer smile :D.His mom was the best part of the whole drama. She was absolutely hilarious.*Review edited by Skye in order to improve grammar and spelling.*","2","6.0","6.0","5.0","5.0","5.0"
"Miranda","I would give it a 0 just if I could. This drama is a shame for women. The main female is totally obsessed. She suffers from some kind of mental illness. She's totally crazy, she's irritating, annoying as anything in this world, I don't even understand why some women support this kind of thing. Also, is boring. The story sets in high school, then college, boring boring nothing different, everyone is crazy in this drama, some hate the main (male) but why? IT IS A NORMAL REACTION WHEN SOMEONE IS DOING STUPID THINGS TO BE WITH YOU AFTER YOU REJECTED THEM 10000 TIMES.","0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","1.0"
"Yuna67876","OK i'm going to throw a scenario out here for you guys, do you ever have a drama that you felt guilty you have not watched yet that was me watching this. Playful Kiss was really great like I have no reason why i should not have watched this sooner.Story:The Basic premise around this story without going through into main spoiler territory is main female lead's house gets destroyed and moves into main male lead house. The story does get really better as the drama goes on. The romance did not feel rushed to me which is a really nice thing not to go into this drama worrying. The whole story as a whole i give a 8.5.Acting/Cast:I be rally honest this drama acting was great because of Kim Hyun Joong. Kim Hyun Joong was great in Boys Over Flower, and he is one of my favorites that i will watch anything of his. Jung So Min was pretty great as Oh Ha Ni she tried really great. The other cast was fantastic all around. Acting/Cast I give an 8.Music:OK the ost for this show actually is really fantastic i listened to it before writing this because we all have those moments that we listen to the ost after finishing a drama. The music i will give a 9.Rewatch value/ Recommend:Would i rewatch this? Simple Answer yes. I would love to go back to rewatch this because of Kim Hyun Joong because he one of my faves. I would recommend Playful Kiss to people who love Boys Over Flower, and or just starting getting into k dramas.  My rewatch Value is an 8.Overall:Overall I give Playful Kiss a 9, I feel like a 10 would be great but there were episodes where I kinda flt a little bored (but that just me).","0","9.0","8.5","8.0","9.0","8.0"
